## Concepts of Functional Programming

Pure-functions:

- It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
- It does not cause any observable side effects
- function that aren't pure - ones that reads external files, random number genrations,
- mutability is discouraged(modifying global variables)

Immutability:

Referential transparency:

- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input
- pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

Functions as first-class entities:

- functions are treated as values and used as data

Higher-Order Functions
