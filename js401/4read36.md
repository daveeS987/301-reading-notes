## Read 36: Application State with Redux

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”?  
   The cookie is not accessible via JavaScript; hence, it is not as vulnerable to XSS attacks as localStorage.
2. Explain 3rd party cookies.  
   Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server’s code.
3. How do pixel tags work?  
   Pixel tags are typically single pixel, transparent GIF images that are added to a web page. Even though the pixel tag is virtually invisible, it is still served just like any other image you may see online. The trick is that the web page is served from the website’s domain while the image is served from the ad server’s domain. This allows the ad server to read and record the cookie with the unique ID and the extended information it needs to record.
