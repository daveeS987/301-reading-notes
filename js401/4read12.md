## Read 12: OAuth

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is authentication important?
   - To test if user is valid and allow entry into the application
1. Why should we be careful about storing a user’s password?
   - Because our database can be breached and people's info can be stolen. Password's need hashed when stored.
1. What is the difference between hashing and encryption?
   - Encryptions is a two way function meaning it can be decrypted. Hashing is a one way encryption
1. What is the difference between encryption and encoding?
   - Encoding is for maintaining data usability and ecryption is for maintaining data confidentiality and requires use of a key
1. What is a token used for?
   - A token is used to make security decisions and to store tamper-proof information about some system entity. While a token is generally used to represent only security information, it is capable of holding additional free-form data that can be attached while the token is being created.

### Vocabulary Terms

- authentication - validating that users are who they claim to be
- authorization - the process of giving the user permission to access a specific resource or function
- encryption - scrambling information using an algorithm or encryption key
- hashing - a method of a one way encryption
- session - temporary and interactive information interchange between two or more communicating devices, or between a computer and user
- cookie - text files stored on a user’s computer by a web browser, at the request of the web server. Limited to a small amount of data and can only be read by the website that created it.
- token - a symbol representing something
- Basic Auth - the sender places a username:password into the request header. The username and password are encoded with Base64, which is an encoding technique that converts the username and password into a set of 64 characters to ensure safe transmission.
- encoding - transform data into one form to another so it can be readable by most of the systems or that can be used by any external process.
- secret - term used for encryption key
- cryptography - the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries.[2] More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages
