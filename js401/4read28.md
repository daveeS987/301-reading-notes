## Read 28: Component & Composition

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Can a parent component access the state of a child component?  
   Not directly. Its possible but you would need to create a method in the parent element to pass down to child and call that method in the child and grab its state.
1. What can be passed along in a prop variable?
   Variables or methods
1. How can a child component “know” the state of another component?
   It can't know directly. The parent would need to pass down a method through props that allows a child to update a state in the parent element. The siblings would then need to use that method to send their own state to the parent. Once a parent has that information another sibling could know that state if the parent passes down a prop to them.

### Vocabulary Terms

- component props - arguments passed into React components
- component state - object that contains information for the React component
- application state - State is a JavaScript object. It stores a component’s dynamic data and determines the component’s behavior. In other words, it is the interface between any data of changes (backend or local) and the representation of this data with UI-elements in the frontend.
