## Read 29: Routing

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Do child components have direct access to props/state from the parent?  
   Not directly. Parents need to pass down props with methods or properties in order for child components to have access

2. When a component “wraps” another component, how does the child component’s output get rendered?  
   Uses the parents structure to display the child elements. This pattern is useful for creating UI elements that are repeated through out a design.

```
<Main>
  <Content />
</Main>
```

3. Can a component, such as `<Content />`, which is a child also be used as a standalone component elsewhere in the application?  
   Yes

4. What trick can a parent use to share all props with it’s children?  
   Use a spread operator. I think...  
   Example:

```
<ChildComponent {...props}>
```

### Vocabulary Terms

- props.children - is what is between the opening and closing tags of the parent element
- composition - In React, composition is a natural pattern of the component model. It's how we build components from other components, of varying complexity and specialization through props. Depending on how generalized these components are, they can be used in building many other components.
