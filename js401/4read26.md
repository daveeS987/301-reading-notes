   Vue, angular, ember, preact, next
1. Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?  
   When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow. It provides some places for you to plug in your code, but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.

### Vocabulary Terms
