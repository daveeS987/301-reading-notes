## Read / Write files

```python

files = open('dog_breeds.txt')

try:
    # Further file processing goes here
finally:
    files.close()

with open('dog_breeds.txt') as reader:
    # Further file processing goes here
    # will automatically close the file once it leaves this "with" block

```

- The open function can take a second argument

  - 'r' - reading(default)
  - 'w' - writing, truncating(overwriting) the file first
    -'rb' or 'wb' - open in binary mode(read/write using byte data)

- There are three different categories of file objects:

  - Text files
  - Buffered binary files
  - Raw binary files

**Text File types:**

```python
file = open('dog_breeds.txt')
type(file)
<class '_io.TextIOWrapper'>
```

**Buffered Binary File Types:**

```python
open('abc.txt', 'rb')
open('abc.txt', 'wb')
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb')
type(file)
<class '_io.BufferedReader'>
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'wb')
type(file)
<class '_io.BufferedWriter'>
```

**Raw File Types:** not typically used

```python
open('abc.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)
file = open('dog_breeds.txt', 'rb', buffering=0)
type(file)
<class '_io.FileIO'>
```

**Read Methods:**

- .read(size=-1) - reads based on the number os size bytes. No argument, -1, or None reads everything
- .readline(size=-1) - reads at most size number of characters from the line
- .readlines() - returns a list

An example of iterating through the file object

```python
>>> with open('dog_breeds.txt', 'r') as reader:
>>>     # Read and print the entire file line by line
>>>     for line in reader:
>>>         print(line, end='')

```

- note the end variable is to prevent python from adding a newline to the text that is being printed

**Write Methods:**

- .write(string) >> writes string to the file
- .writelines(seq) >> writes the sequence to the file

Working with Bytes

- all the same methods apply, however each of the methods expects and returns a bytes object instead

## Exceptions

- Syntax error - occur when the parser detects an incorrect statement
- Exception error - occurs whenever syntactically correct Python code results in an error
- catching Exception hides all errors, so youll want to refer to a specific exception classes you want to catch and handle
- else statement will run if no exceptions occur
- raise allows you to throw an exception at any time.
- assert enables you to verify if a certain condition is met and throw an exception if it isnâ€™t.
- In the try clause, all statements are executed until an exception is encountered.
  except is used to catch and handle the exception(s) that are encountered in the try clause.
- else lets you code sections that should run only when no exceptions are encountered in the try clause.
- finally enables you to execute sections of code that should always run, with or without any previously encountered exceptions.
